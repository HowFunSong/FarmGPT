The global spatial pattern in soil MBC is similar to that observed in SOC (Crowther et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2013), showing lower values in areas with higher temperature and moisture, with the reason still unclear. On the one hand, plant C inputs are generally higher in areas with higher temperature and moisture, beneficial for MBC; on the other hand, higher soil moisture and soil respiration due to higher temperature may cause lower level of oxygen, unfavorable to most microbes (Coskun et al., 2019). Understanding the response of mi -crobial physiological parameters to climatic factors could help better explain the global patterns of MBC and SOC. To date, empirical re -lationships among climate, plant, soil, microbial physiological traits, and SOC formation are still lacking.The objectives of this study were to establish qualitative rela -tionships between climatic factors and microbial physiological pa -rameters; and to test the correlations between SOC content and microbial physiological traits (i.e., microbial CUE and turnover) and microbial necromass. In addition, examination of these relationships at the large spatial scale should be deployed to generate more gen -eral results which could be helpful for building and evaluating the global Earth system modeling.

These sites cover three different forest types: temperate forests (NWH, Nanweng River; BKT, Boke Tu; LS, Liangshui; ME, Maoer Mountain; CB, Changbai Mountain; QY, Qingyuan; DL, Dongling Mountain; TS, Tai Mountain), subtropical forests (BZ, Bazhong; JG, Jigong Mountain; XS, Xian Mountain; NP, Nanping; HT, Huitong; DH, Dinghu Mountain), and tropical forests (JFL-  N, Jianfengling-  natural forest; JFL-  S, Jianfengling-  secondary forest). MAT at the sampling sites ranges from −2.4 ℃ a t  N W H  t o  2 0 . 9 ℃ at DH and MAP ranges from 474 at BKT to 2449 mm at JFL. More detailed information for sampling sites can be found in Table S1. At each site, three 20 × 20 m large plots were randomly established with a distance of >10 m between each other within a 100 × 100 m sampling plot and five 2 × 2 m subplots were selected within each large plot (each corner and the center of the plot). The spatial geographical coordinates and eleva -tion of each site were recorded by GPS (eTrex Venture, Garmin). In each 2 × 2 m subplot, five random soil samples (0–  10 cm) were col -lected using a soil corer (2.5-  cm diameter) and were homogenized by hand and pooled as one composite sample. The soil samples were collected by 16 groups at the same time from August 18 to 20, 2018 (finished within 2 days). All soil samples were then placed in a box with icebags (to keep the temperature inside between 2 ℃ and 6 ℃) and shipped to the laboratory in the Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences at Shenyang, China within 4 days.",

Fresh soil samples were sieved (<2 mm), with all visible roots being removed, and then soils were stored in a refrigerator under 4 ℃. The subsamples (the composite samples) from five subplots were mixed into a new composite sample and thus the replicate numbers for all analyses were 3 at each site. In the laboratory, one subsample (~50 g) from each replicate was incubated under 60% water hold -ing capacity at the temperature equal to mean growing season tem -perature of the site where the sample was collected for microbial CUE and turnover analyses. And another subsample was air-  dried to determine SOC content, amino sugar (AS) content, soil pH, and soil clay content. Since we were able to finish all the soil sampling and transportation within 1 week, the soil analysis and incubation experiments were done at one time for all the samples from all sites to minimize errors caused by human operation.2.2  |  Microbial traits analysisAfter preincubation (24 h), soil microbial CUE and turnover time were determined using the 18O - H2O tracer method (Spohn et al., 2016).

In agreement with our first hypothesis that microbial necromass is one of the important precursors of soil or -ganic matter (Bradford et al., 2013; Cotrufo et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2011), our study provides empirical evidence of the positive relationship between microbial necromass index (con -tent of AS) and the content of SOC across sites spanning a large gra -dient of climatic and edaphic factors, although this correlation could be a little weaker when removing two samples with the highest SOC values (Figure 1). Besides, the effects of climatic and edaphic fac -tors on SOC were mainly via their regulation on the size of MBC and MNC pools, instead of direct effects (Figure 4), confirming the ne -cessity of considering these pools in SOC modeling (Fan et al., 2021). Microbes should be considered not only as a controlling factor of the consumption of SOC in ESMs (Todd-  Brown et al., 2013), but also as an influencing factor of the production of SOC. We believe the best way to represent this paradoxical role of microbes is to establish the MNC pool and link it to MBC and SOC via microbial turnover rate (τ) and CUE (Frey et al., 2013; Georgiou et al., 2017; Hagerty et al., 2014). GLM analyses suggested that the regression modeling includ -ing microbial physiological variables (MBC, CUE, and τ) had higher prediction power than other ones without these variables (Table S3).

Overall, our results indicate that incorporation of both the “microbial biomass” and the “microbial necromass” pools into ESMs and consideration of their relationships with SOC as the ones demonstrated in our SEM (Figure 4) should greatly improve the prediction of global variations of SOC under the context of changing climate.4.2  |  Variation of microbial CUE and turnover rate across the large spatial scaleIn order to represent MBC and MNC pools in ESMs, we should know the relationships between environmental factors and microbial turnover rate ( τ) and CUE. Our study provides empirical relationships among environmental factors and these microbial physiological pa -rameters, which can facilitate future model development. Empirical observations of microbial CUE across large environmental gradients in soils are scarce (Manzoni et al., 2012).

The 18O incubation ap -proach has been found to have lower estimation of CUE than other approaches due to its consideration of the whole microbial commu -nity and all substrates (Geyer et al., 2019).We found microbial CUE decreased with increasing MAP or MAT from northern sites to southern sites (Figure 2), consistent with our second hypothesis.

Our finding of lower CUE in subtropi -cal areas also explains why subtropical areas were found to have lower MBC despite the higher C inputs compared to temperate areas (Xu et al., 2013). Although soil pH was previously suggested as an important factor controlling microbial CUE (Malik et al., 2018; Manzoni et al., 2012), its relationship with CUE was weak in our studied soils ( p = 0.07; Figure 3), while clay content did not really influence the variation of microbial CUE (Figure 3). Soil pH and clay  content instead seemed to be better predictors of micro -bial turnover rate than MAT and MAP (Figure 3). With the increase in soil pH,  microbial turnover rate significantly increased, probably because of the improvement in the living environment as previous studies found soil pH was the most important controlling factor of  microbial community composition and activity (Fierer & Jackson, 2006; Malik et al., 2018). Similarly, as clay content increased, mi -crobial turnover rate significantly decreased, probably due to the limitation of movement and accessibility to resources (Dungait et al., 2012). It seemed that microbial turnover rate had optimum MAP and MAT above or below which this rate would decrease (Figure 3). Besides, it should be noted that the soil samples in this study were collected only in the growing season.

Our results indicated that plant belowground C biomass was more strongly correlated with SOC than aboveground C biomass (Figures 1 and 4), which is consistent with previous findings (Chen et al., 2018; Miao et al., 2019). In areas with high MAT and MAP, aboveground litter is quickly decomposed and the remaining biomass might not reflect the actual C input to SOC. However, we found net primary productivity was not correlated with SOC either (Figure S4) due to the impacts of decomposition. Previous studies also suggest that belowground rhizosphere dissolved organic C entry may be more efficient than aboveground entry, due to the direct entry of C into the soil (Kallenbach et al., 2016; Sokol & Bradford, 2018). However, it should be noted that the plant biomass data used in this study were derived from modeling with a ~300 m spatial resolution, which may be incompatible with the SOC data from field sampling. More studies on the linkage between plant biomass and SOC content are needed. Nevertheless, our study re-  emphasizes the necessity to separately model aboveground C inputs and belowground C inputs (Kallenbach et al., 2016; Sokol & Bradford, 2018).In order to represent MBC and MNC pools in SEM as proposed by us (Figure 4), another important parameter besides CUE and τ needs to be studied more, that is, the decomposition rate of micro -bial necromass.

Because microbial necromass may be more tightly bound in the soil matrix than plant debris due to the nature of mi -crobes living on particle surfaces (Cotrufo et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2011), necromass C may be highly protected by soil minerals. This might explain the positive relationship between clay content and soil AS content (Table S5). However, very few studies have quantified the decomposition rate of microbial necromass and its temperature sensitivity (Wang, Wang, Cotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020). Future research is needed to study this parameter and its response to environmental factors in order to better incorporate the microbial necromass pool in ESMs. In addition, whether the use efficiency of MNC by microorganisms is equal to that of plant debris or SOM is unclear and should be studied further in the future.5 | CONCLUSIONOur results supported a more nuanced perspective on SOC produc -tion and storage underpinning the importance of microbial necro-mass pool to SOC storage across a broad spatial and climatic scale (Figure 4).
