Separation of AS derivatives was carried out on an Agilent 6890 GC (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a Scientific Ultra-  2 column (25 m × 0.2 mm × 0.33 μm) and flame ionization de -tector. The individual AS derivatives were separated by referencing the retention times of authentic standards containing GluN, GalN, ManN, and MurA. We normalized AS-  C contents by their molecular mass and calculated total soil AS-  C as the sum of GluN-  C, GalN-  C, ManN, and MurA-  C (Joergensen, 2018).2.4  |  Soil propertiesSoil pH was measured at a ratio of fresh soil to water ratio of 1:2.5 (soil:water) by a pH electrode (Leici). SOC and total nitrogen con -tent of air-  dried soils were measured with an elemental analyzer after being ground by a ball mill (MAT-  253; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Contents of clay and silt of air-  dried bulk soil were determined by the hydrometer method.2.5  |  Climate and plant biomassThe MAP and MAT of each sampling site were extracted from maps of global temperature and precipitation provided by WorldClim database (www.world  clim.org). The plant aboveground standing biomass C (AGBC, Mg  C ha−1) and belowground standing biomass C (BGBC, Mg  C ha−1) for each site were extracted from maps that were developed by Spawn et al. (2020). These data are accessible through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) DAAC data repository (https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLD  AAC/1763). Finally, all maps were imported into ArcGIS (version 10.2, ESRI) and then the values of cli -mate variables and plant biomass for each site were extracted using coordinates (latitude and longitude) of our sampling sites.2.6  |  Statistical analysesFirst, we explored the relationships between SOC and C pools (MBC, MNC, AGBC, and BGBC), climate variables (MAP and MAT), soil variables (soil pH and clay), and microbial physiological vari -ables (CUE and τ). Second, we conducted a random forest analysis to identify the relative importance of a given variable compared with other variables. This analysis was run using the randomForest  (https://www.stat.berke  ley.edu/~breim  an/Rando mForests) and rfPermute  (https://github.com/EricA  rcher/  rfPer  mute) packages in R",

Third, we used GLM to examine if includ -ing microbial physiological variables (CUE, τ, and MBC) and MNC could better explain the variations of SOC than the model without them. To do this, we built three models with different numbers of SOC response variables: model A included all predictors; model B included all except MNC; and model C included all except for micro -bial physiological variables (CUE, τ, and MBC) and MNC. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to select the best model and the lower AIC means a better-  fit model. This analysis was run using the MuMIn  package (version 1.43.15, https://cran.r-  proje  ct.org/web/packa  ges/MuMIn/  index.html). Finally, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of MAT, BGBC, soil clay, and microbial physiological variables (MBC, CUE, and τ) and necromass on SOC.

 Document(page_content='|\u2003 2041WANG et Al.equation modeling to assess the roles of climate, plant, soil, micro -bial physiological traits, and necromass in SOC content. We hypoth -esize that (1) MBC and necromass C had positive relationships with the SOC content across the large spatial scale; (2) soil microbial CUE decreased with mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP) of sampling sites, while microbial biomass turnover rate in -creased with MAT and MAP; both were important to the spatial vari -ations of MBC and SOC; and (3) the regression model representing microbial physiological parameters could better explain the varia -tions of SOC across the large spatial scale than the one without the microbial physiological parameters.2\u2003|\u2003MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1\u2003 |\u2003 Experimental designSoil samples were collected from 16 forest sites along a north– south transect in eastern China (Figure S1). These sites cover three different forest types: temperate forests (NWH, Nanweng River; BKT, Boke Tu; LS, Liangshui; ME, Maoer Mountain; CB, Changbai Mountain; QY, Qingyuan; DL, Dongling Mountain; TS, Tai Mountain), subtropical forests (BZ, Bazhong; JG, Jigong Mountain; XS, Xian Mountain; NP, Nanping; HT, Huitong; DH, Dinghu Mountain), and tropical forests (JFL-  N, Jianfengling-  natural forest; JFL-  S, Jianfengling-  secondary forest). MAT at the sampling sites ranges from −2.4 ℃ a t  N W H  t o  2 0 . 9 ℃ at DH and MAP ranges from 474 at BKT to 2449 mm at JFL. More detailed information for sampling sites can be found in Table S1. At each site, three 20 × 20 m large plots were randomly established with a distance of >10 m between each other within a 100 × 100 m sampling plot and five 2 × 2 m subplots were selected within each large plot (each corner and the center of the plot). The spatial geographical coordinates and eleva -tion of each site were recorded by GPS (eTrex Venture, Garmin). In each 2 × 2 m subplot, five random soil samples (0–  10 cm) were col -lected using a soil corer (2.5-  cm diameter) and were homogenized by hand and pooled as one composite sample. The soil samples were collected by 16 groups at the same time from August 18 to 20, 2018 (finished within 2 days). All soil samples were then placed in a box with icebags (to keep the temperature inside between 2 ℃ and 6 ℃) and shipped to the laboratory in the Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences at Shenyang, China within 4 days.', metadata={}),

 Document(page_content='2042\u2003 |\u2003\u2003\u2002WANG et Al.A conversion factor ( fDNA) was calculated at each specific sample to represent the ratio of soil MBC to soil DNA content ( μg g−1 soil). Microbial growth rate (Growth, ng C g−1 soil h−1) was calculated by multiplying the DNA production rate and fDNA:where DW (g) is the dry weight of soil and t i s  th e  i n c u b a ti o n  ti m e  (h). Additionally, microbial basal respiration rate (Respiration, ng C g−1 soil h−1) was calculated by the following equation:where p is the atmosphere pressure (kPa), n  is the molecular mass of the element C (12.01  g mol−1), R is the ideal gas constant (8.314  J mol−1 K−1), and T is the absolute temperature of the gas (295.15  K). V is the head -space volume (L) of the vials. Rs (ppm) is the amount of CO2 concentra -tion produced during the 24-  h incubation period.Microbial CUE and microbial biomass turnover rate ( τ, year−1) were calculated by the following equations (Spohn et al., 2016):  where DNAcontent (μg) is the DNA content in each soil, and t is incuba -tion time in hours.2.3\u2003 |\u2003 Measurement of ASWe used ASC in soil to indicate the soil microbial necromass C (MNC; Joergensen, 2018). ASs, including glucosamine (GluN), galac -tosamine (GalN), mannosamine (ManN), and muramic acid (MurA), were determined according to the protocol of Zhang and Amelung (1996). Briefly, soil samples (containing about 0.3 mg N) were hy -drolyzed with 6 M HCl (10 ml) for 8 h, and the solution was subse -quently filtered, centrifuged, and freeze-  dried. Methanol was then added to the freeze-  dried supernatants and centrifuged to extract ASs from the residues. The ASs were reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 4-  (dimethylamino) pyridine and acetic anhy -dride, and the AS derivatives were separated on a DB-  5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm) with temperature program set by Zhang and Amelung (1996). Separation of AS derivatives was carried out on an Agilent 6890 GC (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a Scientific Ultra-  2 column (25 m × 0.2 mm × 0.33 μm) and flame ionization de -tector. The individual AS derivatives were separated by referencing the retention times of authentic standards containing GluN, GalN, ManN, and MurA. We normalized AS-  C contents by their molecular mass and calculated total soil AS-  C as the sum of GluN-  C, GalN-  C, ManN, and MurA-  C (Joergensen, 2018).2.4\u2003 |\u2003 Soil properties', metadata={})]
