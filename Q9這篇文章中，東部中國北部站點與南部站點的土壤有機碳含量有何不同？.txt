In the SEM analysis, we compared the model-  implied variance–  covariance matrix against the observed variance–  covariance matrix. Data were fitted to the models using both the maximum-  likelihood estimation method and the Bayesian analysis. For simplicity, the least significant path was deleted and the model was re-  estimated; then the next least significant path was removed, and so on, until the paths that remained in the final SEM were all significant. Model fit statistics include the degree of freedom ( df), ratio of chi-  square and df (χ2/df), probability level ( p), R2 (proportion of variance explained), and com -parative fit index. The SEM analysis was conducted in the environ -ment of Amos 20.0 (Amos Development Company).3 | RESULTS3.1  |  SOC across large spatial scalesFor soils sampled from 16 spatially dispersed forest sites across east -ern China (Figure S1; Table S1), the SOC content generally  decreased from northern sites to southern sites, with a range of 18.3– 108.7 mg C g−1 soil and an average of 43.6 mg C g−1 soil (T able S2). Similarly, soil MBC and ASC showed a declining pattern from north to south with a range from 0.11 to 3.78 mg C g−1 soil and from 0.38 to 2.31 mg C g−1 soil, respectively (Table S2).Across all sites, MBC and AS were significantly positively cor -related with SOC (Figure 1a,b). After removing the two points with the highest SOC values, the correlation between AS and SOC got less strong ( R2 = 0.64 vs. R2 = 0.90 with the two samples), but still indicating the robust correlation between the two parameters. A marginal positive correlation between belowground biomass C (BGBC) and SOC was observed (Figure 1d; R2 = 0.19, p = 0.09), but aboveground biomass C (AGBC) was not correlated with SOC (Figure 1c). There were significant negative relationships between SOC and MAP (Figure 2a) and MAT (Figure 2b), while positive rela -tionships between SOC and soil clay content (Figure 2d) and micro -bial CUE (Figure 2e) were observed.3.2  |  Responses of microbial physiological variables to climatic and edaphic factorsRegression analyses showed that microbial CUE was negatively cor -related with MAP (Figure 3a; R2 = 0.38, p <  0.01) and MAT (Figure 3b; R2 = 0.52, p <  0.01), but was marginally positively correlated with soil",

[Document(page_content='1. Soil samples were collected from 16 forest sites along a north– south transect in eastern China.2. The sites cover three different forest types: temperate, subtropical and tropical forests.3. Mean annual temperature (MAT) of the sampling sites ranges from -2.4°C to 20.9°C.4. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) of the sampling sites ranges from 474 to 2449 mm.5. Five 2x2m subplots were selected within each large plot.6. Five random soil samples (0-10 cm) were collected from each subplot.7. Soil samples were collected by 16 groups within 2 days and shipped to the laboratory within 4 days.8. Hypotheses: MBC and necromass C had positive relationships with the SOC content across the large spatial scale; soil microbial CUE decreased with MAT and MAP and microbial biomass turnover rate increased with MAT and MAP; regression model representing microbial physiological parameters could better explain the variations of SOC across the large spatial scale.', metadata={}),
