It has been proven that enhancement of C sequestration in soil could help keep the global temperature rise below 1.5°C in 2100 (Huppmann et al., 2018). At present, the processes controlling the formation, transformation, and sequestration of C in soils are still not well understood and the simulation of SOC dynamics in Earth system models (ESMs) needs to be improved (Georgiou et al., 2017; Wieder et al., 2013).\\nThe primary origin of SOC is photosynthetic primary production \\nby vegetation while soil microorganisms are the primary agents of C mineralization, responsible for the loss rate of organic C from soil on the one hand, and the gain of organic C on the other hand via their residues (Crowther et al., 2019; Sokol & Bradford, 2018). The pool size of microbial biomass might affect the size of SOC nega -\\ntively due to its positive effect on C decomposition (Wieder et al., 2013). However, microbes are also considered as contributors to nonliving organic C, somewhat paradoxically, because of the depo -\\nsition of microbially derived C through biomass turnover and nec -\\nromass production (Bradford et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2017; Miltner et al., 2012; Sokol & Bradford, 2018).

In order to better simulate SOC accumulation processes, the \\nparadoxical role of microbial biomass in regulating SOC should be better differentiated and more clearly represented in the models.\\nThe role of microorganisms in decomposing SOC has been ex -\\ntensively explored, but how they contribute to the long-  term per -\\nsistence of SOC is less studied. The emerging view suggests that \\nSOC not only is the direct retention of plant debris in soil through selective preservation or humification process, but also includes the sequestration of microbial necromass (Liang et al., 2017; Miltner et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2011). Results from models indicated that the contribution of microbially derived necromass C to the forma -\\ntion of SOC could be from 10% to 80% (Fan et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2019; Simpson et al., 2007). Moreover, this C has been found to have different structural components and different decomposition patterns from plant-  derived C (Simpson et al., 2007; Wang, Wang, \\nCotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020). Therefore, the \\nhigh contribution of microbial necromass to SOC could be due to their relative slow decomposition rate or the higher chance of min -\\neral protection from decomposition by microorganisms or both (Hagerty et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018; Miltner et al., 2012; Wang, Wang, Cotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020).

Firstly, high mi -\\ncrobial biomass turnover rate means fast necromass production and therefore potentially more microbially derived SOC (Hagerty et al., 2014; Spohn et al., 2016). If microbial necromass was readily recycled into microbial biomass and decomposed, it would not contribute sig -\\nnificantly to the stable SOM pool. However, recent studies suggest that the decomposition rate of microbial necromass could be quite low once it is protected by soil minerals and oxides (Wang, Wang, Cotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020), making it nec -\\nessary to model microbial necromass as a separate pool from plant- derived SOC. Secondly, microbial CUE, defined as the proportion of substrate C that microorganisms assimilate for growth out of total uptake C, has been shown to be an important microbial physiology parameter to improve the performance of model prediction of SOC variations under global climate changes (Frey et al., 2013; Georgiou et al., 2017; Malik et al., 2018). Higher CUE generally means more production of microbial biomass and other microbial products when the total uptake of C remains constant, potentially beneficial for the storage of microbially derived C in soils (Cotrufo et al., 2013). Therefore, building the connections among microbial physiology pa -\\nrameters (i.e., CUE and turnover rate), biomass, and necromass will be helpful for understanding the microbially driven soil C cycles.\\nAbiotic factors, such as temperature and moisture, may influence \\nmicrobial physiology parameters and then indirectly impact soil C cycling processes (Luo et al., 2017).

However, previous studies have not reached a consensus on the relationship between climatic fac -\\ntors and microbial CUE or microbial turnover rate (Manzoni et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2019) and studies at large spatial scales spanning a wide range of temperature and moisture are particularly scarce. The global spatial pattern in soil MBC is similar to that observed in SOC (Crowther et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2013), showing lower values in areas with higher temperature and moisture, with the reason still unclear. On the one hand, plant C inputs are generally higher in areas with higher temperature and moisture, beneficial for MBC; on the other hand, higher soil moisture and soil respiration due to higher temperature may cause lower level of oxygen, unfavorable to most microbes (Coskun et al., 2019). Understanding the response of mi -\\ncrobial physiological parameters to climatic factors could help better explain the global patterns of MBC and SOC.

Our finding of lower CUE in subtropi -\\ncal areas also explains why subtropical areas were found to have lower MBC despite the higher C inputs compared to temperate areas (Xu et al., 2013). Although soil pH was previously suggested as an important factor controlling microbial CUE (Malik et al., 2018; Manzoni et al., 2012), its relationship with CUE was weak in our studied soils ( p = 0.07; Figure 3), while clay content did not \\nreally influence the variation of microbial CUE (Figure 3).

Our results indicated that plant belowground C biomass was more strongly correlated with SOC than aboveground C biomass (Figures 1 and 4), which is consistent with previous findings (Chen et al., 2018; Miao et al., 2019). In areas with high MAT and MAP, aboveground litter is quickly decomposed and the remaining biomass might not reflect the actual C input to SOC. However, we found net primary productivity was not correlated with SOC either (Figure S4) due to the impacts of decomposition. Previous studies also suggest that belowground rhizosphere dissolved organic C entry may be more efficient than aboveground entry, due to the direct entry of C into the soil (Kallenbach et al., 2016; Sokol & Bradford, 2018). However, it should be noted that the plant biomass data used in this study were derived from modeling with a ~300 m spatial resolution, which \\nmay be incompatible with the SOC data from field sampling. More studies on the linkage between plant biomass and SOC content are needed. Nevertheless, our study re-  emphasizes the necessity to \\nseparately model aboveground C inputs and belowground C inputs \\n(Kallenbach et al., 2016; Sokol & Bradford, 2018).\\nIn order to represent MBC and MNC pools in SEM as proposed \\nby us (Figure 4), another important parameter besides CUE and τ needs to be studied more, that is, the decomposition rate of micro -\\nbial necromass.

{"instruction": "\n你們研究中提到的微生物有機碳的分解率和溫度敏感性有什麼關聯？", "input": "page_content='(Kallenbach et al., 2016; Sokol & Bradford, 2018).\\nIn order to represent MBC and MNC pools in SEM as proposed \\nby us (Figure 4), another important parameter besides CUE and τ needs to be studied more, that is, the decomposition rate of micro -\\nbial necromass. Because microbial necromass may be more tightly bound in the soil matrix than plant debris due to the nature of mi -\\ncrobes living on particle surfaces (Cotrufo et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2011), necromass C may be highly protected by soil minerals. This might explain the positive relationship between clay content and soil AS content (Table S5). However, very few studies have quantified the decomposition rate of microbial necromass and its temperature sensitivity (Wang, Wang, Cotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020). Future research is needed to study this parameter and its response to environmental factors in order to better incorporate the microbial necromass pool in ESMs. In addition, whether the use efficiency of MNC by microorganisms is equal to that of plant debris or SOM is unclear and should be studied further in the future.\\n5\\u2003|\\u2003CONCLUSION\\nOur results supported a more nuanced perspective on SOC produc -\\ntion and storage underpinning the importance of microbial necro-mass pool to SOC storage across a broad spatial and climatic scale (Figure 4). We provided empirical relationships among major climatic factors, edaphic factors, and microbial CUE and turnover rate, which can facilitate future model development. The better performance of GLM with microbial physiological parameters than the models with -\\nout microbial physiological parameters (Table S3) calls for our atten -\\ntion to the properties of microbial necromass under the changing environment.
