It has been proven that enhancement of C sequestration in soil could help keep the global temperature rise below 1.5°C in 2100 (Huppmann et al., 2018). At present, the processes controlling the formation, transformation, and sequestration of C in soils are still not well understood and the simulation of SOC dynamics in Earth system models (ESMs) needs to be improved (Georgiou et al., 2017; Wieder et al., 2013).\\nThe primary origin of SOC is photosynthetic primary production \\nby vegetation while soil microorganisms are the primary agents of C mineralization, responsible for the loss rate of organic C from soil on the one hand, and the gain of organic C on the other hand via their residues (Crowther et al., 2019; Sokol & Bradford, 2018). The pool size of microbial biomass might affect the size of SOC nega -\\ntively due to its positive effect on C decomposition (Wieder et al., 2013). However, microbes are also considered as contributors to nonliving organic C, somewhat paradoxically, because of the depo -\\nsition of microbially derived C through biomass turnover and nec -\\nromass production (Bradford et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2017; Miltner et al., 2012; Sokol & Bradford, 2018). In addition, SOC could be sub -\\nstrates for microbes and affects the size of microbial biomass posi -\\ntively. Therefore, a positive relationship between microbial biomass C (MBC) and SOC has often been found (Crowther et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2013), different from what Michaelis–  Menten kinetics sug -\\ngest.

MBC is the amount of carbon stored within the bodies of living microorganisms, and it plays a significant role in controlling the process of carbon cycling in soil, as it influences the production, decomposition, and retention of SOC. \n\nMBC is a major factor in the transformation of organic matter to SOC, as microbial activity is necessary for the formation of stable organic carbon compounds, such as humus. Microbes, such as fungi, are key agents for the breakdown of organic matter, and they create stable SOC through the process of humification. Additionally, MBC has an effect on the rate of heterotrophic respiration, which converts SOC back into gaseous carbon dioxide. \n\nFinally, MBC has an important role in determining how much of the organic matter is retained in the soil over large scales. Microbial activity increases the adsorption of organic compounds to soil particles, which creates a buffer against erosion and improves the stability of SOC in soil over time.

In order to better simulate SOC accumulation processes, the \\nparadoxical role of microbial biomass in regulating SOC should be better differentiated and more clearly represented in the models.\\nThe role of microorganisms in decomposing SOC has been ex -\\ntensively explored, but how they contribute to the long-  term per -\\nsistence of SOC is less studied. The emerging view suggests that \\nSOC not only is the direct retention of plant debris in soil through selective preservation or humification process, but also includes the sequestration of microbial necromass (Liang et al., 2017; Miltner et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2011). Results from models indicated that the contribution of microbially derived necromass C to the forma -\\ntion of SOC could be from 10% to 80% (Fan et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2019; Simpson et al., 2007). Moreover, this C has been found to have different structural components and different decomposition patterns from plant-  derived C (Simpson et al., 2007; Wang, Wang, \\nCotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020). Therefore, the \\nhigh contribution of microbial necromass to SOC could be due to their relative slow decomposition rate or the higher chance of min -\\neral protection from decomposition by microorganisms or both (Hagerty et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018; Miltner et al., 2012; Wang, Wang, Cotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020). In ad -\\ndition, microbial physiology parameters, such as biomass turnover rate, defined as the rate of microbial growth per unit microbial biomass, and C use efficiency (CUE) could indirectly impact SOC via their impacts on microbial biomass and necromass. Firstly, high mi -\\ncrobial biomass turnover rate means fast necromass production and therefore potentially more microbially derived SOC (Hagerty et al., 2014; Spohn et al., 2016).

Higher microbial turnover rates and CUE can lead to increased SOC sequestration, as the rate of organic matter input into the soil is more quickly transformed into biomass, which is then stored as SOC in the soil. On the other hand, slower turnover rates and lower CUE efficiency can lead to decreased SOC sequestration, as organic matter is not as effectively transformed into biomass and stored in the soil.\n\nIn addition, the microbial biomass turnover rate and CUE can have further indirect effects on SOC sequestration. For example, a higher microbial biomass turnover rate can lead to increased nutrient availability, which promotes the uptake of carbon by plants. This can further increase SOC sequestration in the soil. Conversely, slower turnover rates and lower CUE can lead to decreased nutrient availability, which then reduces plant carbon uptake and affects SOC"}

However, recent studies suggest that the decomposition rate of microbial necromass could be quite low once it is protected by soil minerals and oxides (Wang, Wang, Cotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020), making it nec -\\nessary to model microbial necromass as a separate pool from plant- derived SOC. Secondly, microbial CUE, defined as the proportion of substrate C that microorganisms assimilate for growth out of total uptake C, has been shown to be an important microbial physiology parameter to improve the performance of model prediction of SOC variations under global climate changes (Frey et al., 2013; Georgiou et al., 2017; Malik et al., 2018). Higher CUE generally means more production of microbial biomass and other microbial products when the total uptake of C remains constant, potentially beneficial for the storage of microbially derived C in soils (Cotrufo et al., 2013).

Temperature can also affect the microbial community structure, with some microorganisms being more tolerant of temperatures than others. Changes in moisture, meanwhile, can influence microbial respiration, enzyme activity, and decomposition rates. This, in turn, can affect the soil carbon cycle, as soil microbes are important players in the process of mineralizing and sequestering organic carbon in the soil.

The global spatial pattern in soil MBC is similar to that observed in SOC (Crowther et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2013), showing lower values in areas with higher temperature and moisture, with the reason still unclear. On the one hand, plant C inputs are generally higher in areas with higher temperature and moisture, beneficial for MBC; on the other hand, higher soil moisture and soil respiration due to higher temperature may cause lower level of oxygen, unfavorable to most microbes (Coskun et al., 2019).

The range of CUE (Carbon Use Efficiency) values across a global synthesis can vary significantly depending on a range of factors, including the type of synthesis, the sources of biomass to be analyzed, and the environmental conditions present. Here I'll provide an overview of the range of CUE values with further details on potential factors that can affect them. \n\n% overview\n\nAt its simplest, CUE values range from 0, representing essentially no efficiency with all carbon assimilated being released as respiration, to 1, representing perfect efficiency at which all carbon assimilated is accumulated in the biomass. In a fully balanced system, CUE will usually be between 0.3 and 0.45, although this can vary widely depending on the availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, water, and other environmental factors.\n\n%Range in relation to plants\n\nIn most green plants, CUE values can range from 0.04 to around 1.0. This range is largely dependent on the specific organism or species being studied, with each having their own unique CUE efficiency based on the environmental conditions they are adapted to. For example, a low CUE value of 0.04 would be found in a nitrogen-limited environment, while a higher"}

Our finding of lower CUE in subtropi -\\ncal areas also explains why subtropical areas were found to have lower MBC despite the higher C inputs compared to temperate areas (Xu et al., 2013). Although soil pH was previously suggested as an important factor controlling microbial CUE (Malik et al., 2018; Manzoni et al., 2012), its relationship with CUE was weak in our studied soils ( p = 0.07; Figure 3), while clay content did not \\nreally influence the variation of microbial CUE (Figure 3). Soil pH and clay  content instead seemed to be better predictors of micro -\\nbial turnover rate than MAT and MAP (Figure 3). With the increase in soil pH,  microbial turnover rate significantly increased, probably \\nbecause of the improvement in the living environment as previous \\nstudies found soil pH was the most important controlling factor of  microbial community composition and activity (Fierer & Jackson, \\n2006; Malik et al., 2018). Similarly, as clay content increased, mi -\\ncrobial turnover rate significantly decreased, probably due to the limitation of movement and accessibility to resources (Dungait et al., 2012). It seemed that microbial turnover rate had optimum MAP and MAT above or below which this rate would decrease (Figure 3). Besides, it should be noted that the soil samples in this study were collected only in the growing season. The microbial CUE and turnover rate may be different in the nongrowing season and further work on temporal variations of these variables is worth pursuing.\\n4.3\\u2003 |\\u2003 Implication for future model development' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/ML/微生物有機碳 Global Change Biology - 2021 - Wang - Large‐scale importance of microbial carbon use efficiency an.pdf', 'page': 7}", "output": "\nSoil pH is an important environmental factor that influences microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) in soils. Soil pH can directly affect microbes’ access to carbon, as well as their ability to metabolize and allocate the carbon they absorb. The pH range of soils can vary significantly, making it a critical variable in studying microbial CUE. \n\nAt higher pH levels, the carbon in the soil is likely to be bound up, making it less available for microbial respiration and metabolism. This makes it more difficult for the microbes to access the carbon, thus reducing their CUE. On the other hand, lower pH levels tend to release carbon, making it more available for microbial activity. This increase in available carbon can result in higher microbial CUE. \n\nSoil microorganisms also have an important role in CUE. They are able to break down organic material to obtain energy, thus leading to the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Microorganism populations will vary greatly depending on pH levels, as certain species can only survive within certain pH ranges. Microbial activity and diversity can therefore be much higher in soils with lower pH levels, leading to increased microbial CUE. \n\nIn conclusion, soil pH is a major factor in determining microbial"}

Our results indicated that plant belowground C biomass was more strongly correlated with SOC than aboveground C biomass (Figures 1 and 4), which is consistent with previous findings (Chen et al., 2018; Miao et al., 2019). In areas with high MAT and MAP, aboveground litter is quickly decomposed and the remaining biomass might not reflect the actual C input to SOC. However, we found net primary productivity was not correlated with SOC either (Figure S4) due to the impacts of decomposition. Previous studies also suggest that belowground rhizosphere dissolved organic C entry may be more efficient than aboveground entry, due to the direct entry of C into the soil (Kallenbach et al., 2016; Sokol & Bradford, 2018). However, it should be noted that the plant biomass data used in this study were derived from modeling with a ~300 m spatial resolution, which \\nmay be incompatible with the SOC data from field sampling.

It affects the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and can have a significant impact on climate. Under different land use and climate scenarios, organic carbon cycling can vary in multiple ways. \n\nFirst, land use changes can influence organic carbon cycling. Different land use types have different soil properties that can affect the rate of organic carbon cycling. For example, soils under agricultural land use have higher organic matter content and higher activity of microorganisms that decompose organic matter, resulting in higher rates of carbon cycling. In contrast, forest soils generally have higher levels of organic matter, but decomposition rates may be significantly lower due to lower microbial activity. \n\nSecond, changes in climate can also influence organic carbon cycling. Generally, higher temperatures lead to higher microbial activity, which in turn can lead to increased rates of organic carbon cycling. However, other factors such as precipitation and the availability of nutrients can also affect the rate of organic carbon cycling. Warmer climates can also lead to increased water evaporation rates, which can reduce soils' moisture content and can lead to lower rates of organic carbon cycling. \n\nOverall, organic carbon cycling can vary significantly under different land use"}

According to Manzoni et al.'s 2012 study, one of the environmental controls that can affect microbial carbon-use efficiency in soils is temperature. Higher temperatures tend to encourage microbial activity and competition for resources, resulting in higher efficiency. \n\n2. Soil nutrient availability can also have an effect on microbial carbon-use efficiency. In soils with ample nutrient supply, microorganisms usually allocate more energy to maintenance and growth than to carbon-consumption processes. \n\n3. Soil moisture is another important environmental factor that can affect microbial carbon-use efficiency. Too much or too little water can result in a decrease of microbial activity and thus a decrease in efficiency.\n\n4. Manzoni et al. also point out that stoichiometric controls, such as the C:N:P ratio, can affect microbial carbon-use efficiency. A balanced C:N:P ratio is often essential for optimum microbial growth and activity, and subsequently, efficiency."}

(2019) has significant implications for potential soil carbon stabilization strategies. This study demonstrated that soil microbial communities vary greatly in their efficiency of converting carbon into biomass, with some regions being more efficient than others. This suggests that different soil stabilization strategies should be implemented in different regions.\n\nFirst, these findings suggest that soil stabilization strategies need to be tailored to local microbial communities. For example, in regions with efficient microbial communities, carbon sequestration strategies need to focus on maximizing the carbon inputs into the soil. This could include using compost and other organic matter to boost soil fertility, as well as adopting more sustainable agriculture practices.\n\nConversely, in more inefficient microbial communities, strategies should focus on improving the microbial community composition by adding bacteria or fungi that can increase MCUE. This could be achieved through adding beneficial microbes or stimulating the growth of native species through fertilization, cover crops, and other management practices. In other cases, it may even be necessary to introduce genetically modified microbes that can digest more carbon efficiently.\n\nFinally, the findings of Qiao et al. (2019) demonstrate the importance of understanding regional microbial composition when designing soil stabilization strategies. To this end"}

CUE is a measure of the amount of carbon used by the microbial community to produce biomass, while biomass turnover time is the amount of time it takes for the existing microbial biomass to be metabolized and new biomass to be created. In general, deeper soil depths tend to have higher microbial CUE and shorter turnover times than shallow soils. \n\nThe most obvious way that soil depth affects microbial activity is by affecting the amount of energy available for microbial processes. For instance, deeper soils tend to receive more light energy from the sun, and this can result in higher activity rates. Furthermore, deeper soils tend to contain more nutrients and organic matter, which can increase microbial abundance and activity. \n\nSoil depth can also alter the type of microbial environment available for different processes. For example, deeper soils tend to have lower oxygen concentrations, and this can favor microbial metabolisms that use alternative electron acceptors. This means that deeper soils can create a more diverse range of microbial processes, which can contribute to higher CUE and shorter biomass turnover times. \n\nFinally, soil depth can affect microbial activity by altering the amount of physical and chemical stress experienced by the microbial"}

Microbes play an essential role in nitrogen cycling, as they break down organic matter, release nitrogenous compounds, and convert nitrogen gas into usable forms. In soils with increased microbial turnover, the process of nitrogen cycling is accelerated, resulting in higher levels of nitrogen available for plants to use. However, it is important to note that not all nitrogen is taken up by plants and some can be lost from the system. Therefore, it is important to examine the balance of nitrogen rates in and out of the soil to ensure long-term sustainability."}

Necromass, or dead organic matter, is a key component of soil organic carbon (SOC) and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. Soil organic carbon is essential for the healthy functioning of ecosystems, as it contributes to fertility, moisture retention, and a number of other biophysical processes. In addition, SOC uptake through necromass can help to mitigate the effects of global climate change. \n\nNecromass is created by the decomposition of living organisms and is incorporated into soils through the process of mineralization. Necromass is composed of recalcitrant C and plays an influential role in the global carbon cycle by increasing SOC stocks. By improving fertility, necromass increases the carbon-capture potential of soils and reduces the amount of carbon lost to the atmosphere. This then leads to a reduction in atmospheric CO2, or greenhouse gases, and a decrease in global warming. \n\nNecromass is also an important factor in the health of ecosystems. It helps to improve soil fertility, which directly impacts plant health and biodiversity. Additionally, the presence of necromass in soils helps to improve water"}
