Yet, in contrast to other regions in Europe, several factors have helped such that today there are relatively favourable conditions for sustain-able development. One factor was that transition from the Blue to the Green Allgäu was not abrupt, but gradual. The textile industry did not collapse suddenly (within few years), so farmers more easily shifted their practices from cropping to livestock maintenance. This transition was enormously supported and fostered by pioneers such as Carl Hinbein and Johann Althaus who established innovative cheese making techniques in the Allgäu.",

                "The subsistence nature of agricultural production, with food security being a main concern among smallholder farmers, increased vulnerability to climate vari-ability. This compounded other non-climatic factors, contributing to household food shortage. For example, in the study area, other causes of food shortage include overselling of food crops and laziness. Smallholder farmers are compelled to over -sell their produce during harvest time, so as to meet other important needs. Laziness, which is inherent in the culture of some local people involved in productive activi-ties, also contributed to food shortages. Such factors were more pronounced in the lowlands than in the other two zones because of the short growing season that limits agricultural activities."

The idea is simple: farmers receive economic compensation for maintain-ing the cultural landscape, which is of great importance for tourism. The model received an award as a “recognised international world-wide project” at EXPO 2000 in Hannover, Germany, and was acknowledged by the scientific community (Hemmer 1997; Maier 1996), and even by researchers from Japan (Kureha 2002).",

Therefore, the overall design of any tourism effort that is a component in a community-based natural resource management plan must ensure that the benefits are channeled to local communities.

Often this applies to smaller regions (e.g. in France larger than one commune, but less than a district).

Yet, in contrast to other regions in Europe, several factors have helped such that today there are relatively favourable conditions for sustain-able development. One factor was that transition from the Blue to the Green Allgäu was not abrupt, but gradual. The textile industry did not collapse suddenly (within few years), so farmers more easily shifted their practices from cropping to livestock maintenance. This transition was enormously supported and fostered by pioneers such as Carl Hinbein and Johann Althaus who established innovative cheese making techniques in the Allgäu.",

A reoccurring theme throughout this review is that different bird species require different habitat and landscape factors, so universal prescriptions are difficult.

Such a decrease, coupled with increased pro-duction cost, had led some farmers to abandon its production.

Thus, in extensive systems (as in many parts of Ethiopia and Nepal) more access to grazing land tends to be related to bigger livestock herds, which in turn implies greater use of environmental resources such as forest forages. In this study, the vast majority of the respondent farms had small herd sizes and were particularly based on zero-grazing and tethering systems. Thus, in intensive systems, larger acreage households are more likely to access forages from their own farms as opposed to lower acreage households and hence the likelihood of lesser dependence on forest forages."

One factor was that transition from the Blue to the Green Allgäu was not abrupt, but gradual.

Since most tourism operations are run by outside companies rather than smallhold-ers and the surrounding communities directly, often the community bears most of the costs but does not end up with most of the benefits (West and Carrier 2004). Therefore, the overall design of any tourism effort that is a component in a community-based natural resource management plan must ensure that the benefits are channeled to local communities. These benefits are expected to become additional incentives for residents to protect the forestry and agroforestry systems that the tourists pay to see (Ross and Wall 1999).",
