Coffee is a perennial crop and starts producing fruits after three years. Coffee plants and shade trees require regular pruning to get high-quality green coffee yield.Soil organic carbon (SOC)The importance of SOC dynamics to CFP is indicated by research in Peru (Solis et al. 2020), which documents that polyculture shaded coffee production system may contribute as much as 189 Mg C ha-1 of carbon stock, followed by Inga-shaded (146 Mg C ha-1) and unshaded (113 Mg C ha-1) system.

Although the study only included a few coffee plots, the results showed that plant biodiversity had no effects on C stocks, but that increasing C sequestration by adding more trees would have a negative effect on food production.

These lower reaches were the home of large mammals like elephant, black-and-white rhinoceros, and numerous antelopes from eland to dik- dik, Cape buffalo, giraffe, lions, and leopards. Stream flow throughout the region was low, but continuous. Rainfall did not rush off the landscape when it fell; instead it hit a vegetated surface, slowed, and flowed through the soil and in the water table. Springs were common and continued to exist in much of the region up to the end of the 1940s. That is when the dramatic changes really hit. The local population expanded rapidly.

In addition, a combined coffee-macadamia plantationalso significantly increased the yield of coffee per unit area(Long and Wang, 1996 ). Moreover, coffee white stem borer(Xylotrechus quadripes ) has become a major problem inYunnan coffee-growing region. Therefore, it is recommendedthat coffee plants are planted under a good stand of permanentshading trees as a key strategy to control the white stem borer(Zhang et al., 2002 a,b).
