In addition, a combined coffee-macadamia plantationalso significantly increased the yield of coffee per unit area(Long and Wang, 1996 ). Moreover, coffee white stem borer(Xylotrechus quadripes ) has become a major problem inYunnan coffee-growing region. Therefore, it is recommendedthat coffee plants are planted under a good stand of permanentshading trees as a key strategy to control the white stem borer(Zhang et al., 2002 a,b).

In addition, many trees are stillrelatively young ( ∼5–10 years) in the shaded plantations ofLincang; however, the age of the shades trees are over 10 years inDehong coffee-growing regions. Two different coffee managementswere focused on generating products that were exclusively market-oriented. These coffee-producing systems require high inputs ofchemical fertilizers and an intensive work force throughout theyear. The main fertilizers were urea and compound fertilizers.The characteristics of coffee plantations are shown in Table 1 .Soil samplingIn 2015 –2016, lists of coffee growers within each coffee region",

First, we analyzed how cooper-ative types and history affect approaches to managingshade trees, fertilization, coffee pruning and weedcontrol and the effects of these on soil characteristicsand shade tree density and diversity. Secondly, weasked whether increasing the species richness ofshade trees (number of species), independently fromincreased the density of shade trees (number of trees),would change soil characteristics in ways that couldaffect ecosystem services. To do this we examinedhow cooperatives differed in coffee, fruit andﬁrewood production (provisioning services) and car-",

Three representative smallholder coffee growing sys-tems were selected for this study: (1) Polyculture-shaded coffee: acoffee system with a dense shading polyculture in which the can-opy mainly comprises different fruits and timber trees of differentages; (2) Inga-shaded coffee: it is the most typical coffee system inthe study area and is associated with leguminous species ( Ingaedulis andInga ruiziana ) and (3) unshaded coffee ( Table 1 ).Each coffee growing system was evaluated in one farm in each",
                "many smallholder farmers have shifted from permanent shade-tree coffeeproduction systems to open-shade and/or lightly-shaded coffee productionsystems ( De Beenhouwer et al., 2016 ;Hergoualc'h et al., 2012 ). In addition,farmers often apply a large amount of mineral and organic fertilizers toboost their coffee yield ( De Beenhouwer et al., 2016 ). This change in coffeeproduction systems has had a number of negative impacts, such as biodiver-sity loss ( De Beenhouwer et al., 2016 ;Geeraert et al., 2018 ) and carbon di-oxide (CO 2) emissions ( De Beenhouwer et al., 2016 ;Noponen et al., 2012 ).One of the greatest challenges facing coffee producers today is therefore thedevelopment of management practices that increase yield without havingnegative impacts on the environment."

An additional study conducted in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica documented that pest control services provided by birds to combat the coffee berry borer improved yields between 1% and 14% (Kellermann et al. 2008). In economic terms, this amounted to >$4,000 for farmers of the four small farms investigated, or between 2% and 69% of the per capita gross national income for Jamaica for each farm (Kellermann et al. 2008).But coffee yields are not the only provisioning service provided by shade coffee systems.

In addition, a combined coffee-macadamia plantationalso significantly increased the yield of coffee per unit area(Long and Wang, 1996 ).

Therefore, it is recommendedthat coffee plants are planted under a good stand of permanentshading trees as a key strategy to control the white stem borer(Zhang et al., 2002 a,b).

Given that yield and net income was higher, the high cost of manual labor is offset by the high revenue from the product (FAO 2003).In Chile, where the most important problem was soil erosion, compost was used"

Global NO emissions from uplands ranged from 0.2 to 23 kg N/ha/year, whereas annual NO emissions from Chinese uplands in 2012 were greater than the global average probably due to a higher N fertilization rate of 380 kg N/ha/year (Huang and Li 2014); hence higher fertiliza-tion rates can cause higher NO emissions.

Bacterial communities were most stronglyassociated with soil chemistry, while fungal communities were more strongly associated with the composition of thecanopy and historical land use of the coffee plantation.
