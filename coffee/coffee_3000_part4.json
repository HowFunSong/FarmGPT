The current results indicate that the subsistence farming practices that have been fol-lowed by the smallholder farmers in the study area are exploitative in nature, and thus, have taken much of the soil organic carbon as compared to the natural forest. This loss of organic carbon is likely to increase emission from the soil system. A land use type that enhances the organic carbon content and minimizes emission has to be put in place in order to fight climate change and its unfavorable impacts.

This findinghas implications for the selection of shaded coffee system suitablefor climate change mitigation efforts. There were significant rela-tionships between SOC concentration and soil bulk density, soilpH and soil total nitrogen (N). They are significant factors forthe prediction of coffee system SOC concentration at this site.The results from stepwise multivariate regression analyses con-firmed the importance of climate variable in explaining the varia-tions of coffee plantation SOC concentration in Yunnan.Financial support.

Economic planning and budget should include tangible provisions for promoting policies and programmers of climate change as it relate to aquaculture. Direct reduction of anthropogenic emissions or enhancement of carbon sinks that are necessary for  limiting long-term climate damage would also be necessary.",

Aside from the potential cost savings to be made in reduction of carbon in the supply chain (e.g. , through energy, fertilizers or transport costs), the proper management of emissions is also an opportunity for companies to develop competitive advantages in the marketing of their products or services. Some are already actively doing so. Despite the fact that sustainable practices and reduction of carbon emissions are still largely voluntary in most countries, there is a growing move towards regulation and carbon credit sch emes that seek to incentivize  and reward business for adopting carbon reduction strategies. For this reason it is increasingly important to invest in reduce or even neutralizing the carbon"

The subsistence farming practice followed by the smallholder farmers in the study area is exploitative in nature. As a result, it has taken much of the soil organic carbon, which was found to be relatively higher in the natural forest. This loss of organic car-bon is likely to increase emission from the soil system. Also, the climax reaching vegetation and its impacts on undergrowth plants render the natural forest low car-bon sequestration potential.

SOC play a vital role in maintaining ecosystem health (Smith, 2016 ), and SOC levels are highly conditioned by other properties such as soil texture, porosity, CEC, nutrients availability, aggregate stability and microbial activity (Bationo et al., 2006; Chan, 2008; Abera and Wolde-Meskel, 2013; Esmaeilzadeh and Ahangar, 2014; Gosain et al., 2015; FAO, 2015; Liao et al., 2015 ). In addition, agricultural activities can affect SOC levels and C emissions from terrestrial ecosystems due to land use",
                "ConclusionsThe study demonstrates that even under poor man -agement, soil has higher carbon stock compared with aboveground biomass. The subsistence farming practice followed by the smallholder farmers in the study area is exploitative in nature. As a result, it has taken much of the soil organic carbon, which was found to be relatively higher in the natural forest. This loss of organic car-bon is likely to increase emission from the soil system. Also, the climax reaching vegetation and its impacts on undergrowth plants render the natural forest low car-bon sequestration potential. Hence, it is necessary to implement conservation-based production systems with",

                "equations exist that can be applied to allow for estimation of coarse root C. Carbon sequestration in soil organic matter can be significantly improved in smallholder systems, especially those that include N-fixing trees. Agroforestry practices that increase plant inputs, such as mulch additions of tree pruning residues, may increase soil C over just a few years. Soil C sequestration in tree plantations and agroforestry systems appears to require increased stabilization of soil and soil organic matter as well as increased organic matter inputs. The stability and permanence of this soil C has not been well-studied, but it bears investigation due to the changing vegetation cover and management practices in agro-forestry systems and the relatively short rotations of smallholder plantations.",

                "ers, crop productivity, especially from non-legume grain crops, was limited by inherent soil fertility. Once nutrients were “mined” from the soil by years of crop-ping, the production rates of those soils declined along with the capacity for a reasonable return on labor and seed invested. Basically, nutrients in soil organic material were converted into crop products and once these were exhausted, soils lost their fertility. Pre-industrial farmers mitigated this decline by various means, including:Moving on to other virgin soils•\tResting the land via fallows for several years•\tRotating with green manure crops (usually legumes) grown specifically for •\torganic matter productionRotating with fertility-enhancing food crops such as legume pulses•",
                "In many areas of the world, soil organic matter represents an essential nutrient source for agronomic production where commercial fertilizers are not available. It also plays a key role in governing the form of nutrients available for plant uptake. For instance, a common indicator of organic matter nitrogen content is the carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio. Organic materials with a C:N ratio of less than 25:1 are con-sidered N rich. Nitrogen in this system is subject to mineralization, the conversion of plant-unavailable N to plant-available forms (NH4+ and NO3−). Brady and Weil (2002) describe the process as follows: Organic N (unavailable to plants) largely exists as amine groups (R-NH2) in proteins or as part of humus. Microbial degrada-"

Carbon sequestration in soil organic matter can be significantly improved in smallholder systems, especially those that include N-fixing trees. Agroforestry practices that increase plant inputs, such as mulch additions of tree pruning residues, may increase soil C over just a few years. Soil C sequestration in tree plantations and agroforestry systems appears to require increased stabilization of soil and soil organic matter as well as increased organic matter inputs. The stability and permanence of this soil C has not been well-studied, but it bears investigation due to the changing vegetation cover and management practices in agro-forestry systems and the relatively short rotations of smallholder plantations.",

The concepts include:• Reversibility: A subsequent change in management can reverse the gains made in carbon sequestration over a similar period of time. However, many agricultural mitigation options such as reduction in N2O and CH4 emissions, avoided emis-sions as a result of agricultural energy efficiency gains or substitution of fossil fuels by bioenergy are reversible.• Reference: The greenhouse gas net emission reductions need to be assessed rela-tive to a reference baseline. The selection of an appropriate baseline to measure management-induced soil carbon changes is still an obstacle in some mitigation projects.",

However, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) program through the United Nations has supported the develop-ment of community-based projects. The high transaction and monitoring costs of these projects can be a financial disincentive, so the development and support of community-level capacity to plan, implement, and manage these projects is critical to their success."

Coffee is the fourth largest foreign exchange earner for Indone -sia after palm oil, rubber and cocoa in the agricul -tural commodity group. On the basis on data from the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics/BPS (2017), Indonesia’s coffee exports in 2017 reached 467,800 tons with a value of US $ 1,187,157. Ac -cording to the Agency Central Statistics, in 2017 the area of   coffee plantations in Indonesia reached 1,253,796 ha. Total production of Indonesian cof -fee in 2017 reached 668,677 tons.One of the largest areas of land that contrib -",

In the 2017/2018 season,Brazil produced over 3 million metric tons of coffee (51 million bags), of which 60% was exported, whilst Vietnam pro-duced 1.8 million metric tons of coffee (30 million bags), of which approximately 80% was exported (ICO, 2019).Coffee ’s global significance extends beyond its large consumption numbers to the well documented environmental bur-dens as a result of effluent releases, fertiliser use, and habitat destruction (Hassard et al., 2014). Although there has beensubstantial research into the environmental impacts of coffee production, it has primarily focused on the production phase"
